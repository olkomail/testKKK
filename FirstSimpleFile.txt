Number one is aim for balance. You see it more in your life and work. Whether you working to get job or whether you in job to keep that job. 
Whenever a case may be there is a more to you than just work. Or least it should be. And so you hit a balance. First of all you need time for you. 
Not for your employers, not for your, even not for your improvement as a person. You need time for you to just enjoy life. Life is not all about work.
